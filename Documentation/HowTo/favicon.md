# Customize your favicon

If your website template does not provide a favicon or you don't like the one proposed, you can use your very own.  
Place your favicon into the Resources directory:

```bash
Resources/favicon.png
```

The file has to be `.png`.  
Check out [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) to generate a favicon.
